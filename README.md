# modcsinjector
This project is a tool I created to facilitate data gathering for my master's degree research on service availability. It is a concurrent application developed in Python that aids in injecting failures and repairs into an OpenStack infrastructure. The tool also includes monitoring capabilities to track the infrastructure's behavior and collect valuable data for analysis.
